Here is the correct and clean SQL syntax for your queries with proper formatting and explanation:

15. Select All Records
SELECT * 
FROM tablename;
👉 * means all columns from the table.

16. Display Particular Column
SELECT column_name 
FROM tablename;
👉 This will display only the specified column.

Example:

SELECT name 
FROM students;
17. Display Particular Row
SELECT * 
FROM tablename 
WHERE id = value;
⚠ If id is numeric → no quotes

SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = 5;
If id is string → use quotes

SELECT * FROM students WHERE id = 'A101';
18. Order By (Sorting Data)
Ascending (default):

SELECT column_name 
FROM tablename 
ORDER BY column_name ASC;
Descending:

SELECT column_name 
FROM tablename 
ORDER BY column_name DESC;
Example:

SELECT name 
FROM students 
ORDER BY name ASC;

Your image explains SQL Aggregate Functions 👍
Here is the corrected and clearer version with proper explanation and examples:

📊 Aggregate Functions in SQL
Aggregate functions perform calculations on a column of values and return a single result.

1️⃣ AVG() – Average Value
Returns the average of a numeric column.

SELECT AVG(salary) 
FROM employees;
2️⃣ COUNT() – Number of Rows
Returns the total number of rows.

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM employees;
Count specific column (ignores NULL values):

SELECT COUNT(salary) 
FROM employees;
3️⃣ MAX() – Largest Value
Returns the highest value.

SELECT MAX(salary) 
FROM employees;
4️⃣ MIN() – Smallest Value
Returns the lowest value.

SELECT MIN(salary) 
FROM employees;
5️⃣ SUM() – Total Value
Returns the sum of a numeric column.

SELECT SUM(salary) 
FROM employees;
6️⃣ FIRST() and LAST() ⚠
FIRST() and LAST() are not supported in all databases (like MySQL).

Instead, use:

SELECT column_name 
FROM table_name 
ORDER BY column_name ASC 
LIMIT 1;
For last:

SELECT column_name 
FROM table_name 
ORDER BY column_name DESC 
LIMIT 1;
💡 Important Concept: GROUP BY
Aggregate functions are often used with GROUP BY.

Example:

SELECT department, AVG(salary) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department;

Your image explains SQL Scalar Functions 👍
Here is the corrected and clearer version with proper syntax and examples:

🔹 Scalar Functions in SQL
Scalar functions operate on a single value and return a single value.

1️⃣ UCASE() / UPPER()
Converts text to uppercase.

SELECT UPPER(name) 
FROM students;
2️⃣ LCASE() / LOWER()
Converts text to lowercase.

SELECT LOWER(name) 
FROM students;
3️⃣ MID() / SUBSTRING()
Extracts characters from a string.

SELECT SUBSTRING(name, 1, 3) 
FROM students;
👉 Starts from position 1 and extracts 3 characters.

4️⃣ LEN() / LENGTH()
Returns the length of text.

SQL Server:

SELECT LEN(name) 
FROM students;
MySQL:

SELECT LENGTH(name) 
FROM students;
5️⃣ ROUND()
Rounds a number to specified decimal places.

SELECT ROUND(salary, 2) 
FROM employees;
6️⃣ NOW()
Returns current date and time.

SELECT NOW();
SQL Server:

SELECT GETDATE();
7️⃣ FORMAT()
Formats a value for display.

Example (SQL Server):

SELECT FORMAT(salary, 'N2') 
FROM employees;
🔥 Important Note
Different databases (MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle) use slightly different function names.

🔹 String functions full list

📘 DQL (Data Query Language) in SQL
DQL is used to retrieve data from a database.

👉 It does NOT modify data.
👉 It is used only for fetching / reading records.

🔹 Main Command in DQL
1️⃣ SELECT
This is the only major command in DQL.

🔹 Basic Syntax
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name;
🔹 Examples
✅ 1. Select All Data
SELECT * 
FROM students;
✅ 2. Select Specific Column
SELECT name, age 
FROM students;
✅ 3. Select With Condition (WHERE)
SELECT * 
FROM students
WHERE age > 18;
✅ 4. Sorting Data (ORDER BY)
SELECT * 
FROM students
ORDER BY name ASC;
✅ 5. Using Aggregate Functions
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM students;
✅ 6. Using GROUP BY
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
🔹 DQL vs Other SQL Types
Type	Full Form	Purpose
DQL	Data Query Language	Retrieve data
DML	Data Manipulation Language	Insert, Update, Delete
DDL	Data Definition Language	Create, Drop, Alter
DCL	Data Control Language	Grant, Revoke
🎯 Important for Interviews
Most SQL interview questions are based on:

SELECT

WHERE

GROUP BY

HAVING

ORDER BY

JOINS

📘 Meaning of DQL
DQL (Data Query Language) means:

👉 A part of SQL used to retrieve (fetch) data from a database.

It is used only for reading data, not for changing or deleting it.

🔹 Simple Meaning
Data → Information stored in database

Query → Question or request

Language → Method to communicate

So,

DQL = Language used to ask questions from a database

🔹 Example
SELECT * FROM students;
This query retrieves all data from the students table.

🔹 Important Point
DQL mainly includes only one command:

✅ SELECT
